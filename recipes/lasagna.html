    Here's a traditional recipe for lasagna along with the ingredients needed:</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat. If using beef, make sure to break it up into crumbles. Once cooked, remove any excess fat from the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Add the dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. If using oven-ready noodles, you can skip this step.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. 
        Mix well until they are thoroughly combined.</li>

        <li>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. 
        Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
        Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them.</li>

        <li>Spread a layer of the meat sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of
         the ricotta cheese mixture.
          Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>

        <li>Repeat the layers, starting with noodles and alternating between meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese until all the ingredients are used. Make sure to finish with a layer of meat sauce and
         a final sprinkle of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>

        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

        <li>Once the lasagna is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>

        <li>Slice the lasagna into servings and serve it hot. It pairs well with a side salad and garlic bread.</li>
    </ol>
