        <li>1 medium-sized green bell pepper (capsicum), finely chopped</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Pav Bhaji masala (readily available spice blend)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
       <li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a large pan or skillet on medium heat.</li>

        <li>Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.
             Then, add asafoetida (hing) and sauté for a few more seconds.</li>

        <li>Add minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and sauté until the raw smell disappears.</li>

        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>

        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>

        <li>Now, add the finely chopped bell pepper (capsicum) and cook for a few minutes until it becomes tender.</li>

        <li>Add the chopped cauliflower, mashed potatoes, and mashed green peas to the pan.
             Mix well and mash the vegetables together using a potato masher or a fork.</li>

        <li>Add Pav Bhaji masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
             Mix everything together until the spices are well incorporated.</li>

       <li> Add water to the pan, starting with about 1/2 cup, and stir well. 
        You can adjust the amount of water depending on your desired consistency. Simmer the bhaji for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, 
        until the flavors meld together and the bhaji thickens slightly.</li>

        <li>While the bhaji is simmering, prepare the pav. 
            Slit the pav bread rolls horizontally, but not all the way through, keeping one end intact.</li>

       <li> Heat a griddle or a large skillet and melt butter on it. 
        Place the pav on the skillet, cut side down, and toast them until they turn light golden brown and crispy.
         Flip them and toast the other side as well. Remove from the skillet.</li>

        <li>Once the bhaji is ready, garnish it with freshly chopped coriander leaves.</li>

        <li>Serve the hot and spicy Pav Bhaji in a plate, accompanied by the toasted pav bread rolls, a dollop of butter on top of the bhaji, and lemon wedges on the side.</li>

        <li>Squeeze some lemon juice on the bhaji, mix it well, and enjoy it with the buttery pav.</li>
    </ol>
